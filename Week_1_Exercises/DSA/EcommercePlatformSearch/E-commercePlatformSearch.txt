1. Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.

Big O Notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements in terms of the size of the input data. It describes the worst-case scenario for an algorithm's performance, making it easier to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.

For example:
O(1): Constant time, doesn't change with input size.
O(n): Linear time, grows proportionally with input size.
O(n^2): Quadratic time, grows with the square of the input size.

2. Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

Best Case: The search finds the element immediately, ie Minimum number of steps.

Average Case: The search takes a typical number of steps to find the element.

Worst Case: The search takes the maximum number of steps, often when the element is not present.


3. Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.

(i)Linear Search:
Best Case: The target element is the first element in the array.
Time Complexity: O(1)

Average Case: The target element is somewhere in the middle of the array.
Time Complexity: O(n/2), simplified to O(n)

Worst Case: The target element is the last element or not present in the array.
Time Complexity: O(n)

(ii)Binary Search:
Best Case: The target element is the middle element of the sorted array.
Time Complexity: O(1)

Average Case: The target element is in the array, requiring several comparisons.
Time Complexity: O(log n)

Worst Case: The target element is not present in the array.
Time Complexity: O(log n)


4. Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

Linear Search is suitable for small or unsorted lists because it's simple and doesn’t require sorting.
Binary Search is better for large, sorted lists because it’s faster, reducing the number of checks needed.
For an e-commerce platform with many products, Binary Search is generally more suitable due to its efficiency with large, sorted data.
