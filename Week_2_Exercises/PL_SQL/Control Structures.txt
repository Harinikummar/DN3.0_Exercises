Scenario 1:
Write a PL/SQL block that loops through all customers, checks their age, and if they are above 60, apply a 1% discount to their current loan interest rates.

BEGIN
    FOR rec IN (SELECT l.LoanID, l.InterestRate, c.DOB
                FROM Loans l
                JOIN Customers c ON l.CustomerID = c.CustomerID) LOOP
        IF MONTHS_BETWEEN(SYSDATE, rec.DOB) / 12 > 60 THEN
            UPDATE Loans
            SET InterestRate = rec.InterestRate - 1
            WHERE LoanID = rec.LoanID;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;


Scenario 2:
Write a PL/SQL block that iterates through all customers and sets a flag IsVIP to TRUE for those with a balance over $10,000.

ALTER TABLE Customers ADD (IsVIP VARCHAR2(5));

BEGIN
    FOR rec IN (SELECT CustomerID, Balance FROM Customers) LOOP
        IF rec.Balance > 10000 THEN
            UPDATE Customers
            SET IsVIP = 'TRUE'
            WHERE CustomerID = rec.CustomerID;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;


Scenario 3:
Write a PL/SQL block that fetches all loans due in the next 30 days and prints a reminder message for each customer.

DECLARE
    CURSOR loan_cursor IS
        SELECT l.LoanID, c.Name, l.EndDate
        FROM Loans l
        JOIN Customers c ON l.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
        WHERE l.EndDate <= SYSDATE + 30;
BEGIN
    FOR rec IN loan_cursor LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Reminder: Loan ' || rec.LoanID || ' for customer ' || rec.Name || ' is due on ' || TO_CHAR(rec.EndDate, 'YYYY-MM-DD'));
    END LOOP;
END;
